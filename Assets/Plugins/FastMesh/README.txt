███ Main Features ███

Basis 
To draw a 3D shape, first draw its front view, then its side view. The program will connect these 
drawings to create a solid object!

Bevel Modifier
The Bevel tool provides the ability to create chamfered edges on 3D objects. It ensures a smooth 
transition between faces, giving the object a more realistic and complete appearance.

Revolve Modifier
The "Revolve" tool creates an object that repeats the shape around a central axis, allowing for the 
quick generation of symmetrical 3D forms. This tool is particularly useful when creating objects with 
circular symmetry, such as vases, bowls, bottles, and other objects of rotation.

Use of your images
You can not only draw on the canvas to create 3D objects, but also upload your own images.

"2D to 3D" Mode
The "2D to 3D" mode allows to add depth to two-dimensional images, turning them into three-dimensional 
objects. Suitable for elongated objects such as handles, pipes, etc.

Cutout Tool
The "Cutout" tool allows cutting holes in 3D objects

Eraser Tool
The "Eraser" tool allows you to remove parts of an object at any angle.

Split Tool
Use the 'Split' tool to divide a layer into two parts. You can draw cutting lines along which the 
division will take place. This allows you to edit the resulting parts independently of each other.
